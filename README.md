# Simple Score

This is a program I started as my first big project in C++. I wanted to create an application that makes it easier to combine music notation with user-generated graphics; this is a good first step in that direction, as users can draw primitives in conjunction with traditional musical score elements, and can change the size and color of objects, lock them, and combine them with others into larger, manipulatable units. This program uses the Leland font to provide users with an array of standard musical score elements; primitives are generated with the Windows API and OpenGL. I've been working on this program using the Windows API to give me more easy access to options like creating menus and dialog windows. I am working on including text elements in this program and would also like to improve how the notation is generated, as it is a little unwieldy right now. This program currently functions as an experimental platform for producing novel musical scores, leaning more heavily on user-generated graphics than on traditional score formatting.
